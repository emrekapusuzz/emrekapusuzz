#### About Me:
A bachelor degree Electrical and Electronics Engineer. End of my university years I took lessons like Optimization Techniques, 
Statistics, Machine Learning Algorithms, Probability. I made my thesis about Support Vector Machines. The interest I grew in ML Algorithms, 
made me work on Python and data science basics. Since 2018 I've been studying these concepts and analysing public data.
Playing around data, creating hypotheses, testing these hypotheses and building a machine learning model,
and learning new concepts each day is something that really makes me excited.
